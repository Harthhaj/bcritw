Best Cooking Recommender in The World.

Just a `Prolog` project for the college.

## Introduction

In this CLI-Based program, you are supposed to tell it what are the ingredients you have (by answering yes/no questions), and it'll recommend you some meals to cook with these ingredients, and also it will tell you how to prepare that meal.

## Requirements

- `SWI-Prolog`

## How To Run

Type the following on your terminal:

- ```cd <project-folder-path>```
- ```swipl main.pl```

(do not forget to replace `<project-folder-path>` with the actual path)
